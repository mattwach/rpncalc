# rpncalc Overview

Why another calculator app?  That is an excellent question.  Knowing that your
time is valuable, this short block of text will give you the "short sell" for
`rpncalc`.

First, what is an RPN calculator? It's a calculator that uses a stack.  Once
learned, it allows many people to enter expressions more quickly and with fewer
mistakes.  Check out more here
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation

rpncalc takes your basic RPN calculator design and adds many user convenience
tools.  These include the following:

## Basic Examples

5 + 5

    |> 5 5 +
    y = 10.0  

sqrt(3 * 3 + 4 * 4).  A few different ways.

    |> 3 3 * 4 4 * + sqrt
    y = 5.0            

    |> 3 2 ** 4 2 ** + sqrt
    y = 5.0            

    |> 3 d * 4 d * + sqrt
    y = 5.0            

Area of a circle of radius 5

    |> 5 2 ** v:pi *

states.

## Readline Support

All the readline goodness, such as persistent history and robust key editing
support

## Variables and Macros

Automate and simplify complex and repetitive tasks

## Batch and Interactive Modes

Supports easy piping of results when run with arguments and an interactive
mode when run without arguments.
"""

DOCS['Clipboard'] = r"""
rpncalc supports 3 types of clipboards:

### Standard Clipboard

You can copy between this clipboard and the stack with 'c' and 'v'.  You can
also 'cut' (pop) the last value on the stack to the clipboard with 'x'.

You can also use pc, px, and pv to cut. copy and paste values deeper in the
stack.  Here is an example that solves the quadratic formula without creating
named global variables.  The Formula is (sqrt(b*b - 4ac) - b)/(2a)

### Variable Clipboard

This clipboard allows you to cut copy and paste to variable names, you can
also dump the current set of defined variables for reference

#### Examples:

    now c:start_time   # copy the current time into 'start_time'
    now v:start_time - # Find the delta between 'start_time' and the current
                       # time
    l:v                # see what variables are currently defined

### Stack Clipboard

You can also copy and paste the entire clipboard with the capitalized
operators 'X', 'C' and 'V'.  Note that 'V' completely overwrites the existing
stack.  The 'X' operator is also useful for cleaning up miscellaneous values
from a stack after a calculation.

#### Examples:

This example uses named variables.  The risks here are typical global variable
risks, such as submacros using the same varible names or a macro wiping out
a variable you assumed was safe:

    m:quadratic1              \ # assume the stack contains a, b, c, in order
      x:c x:b x:a             \ # grab the variables
      v:b d * 4 v:a v:c * * - \ # w = b*b-4*a*c  stack is: w
      sqrt v:b -              \ # x = sqrt(w) - b
      2 v:a * /                 # x/2a completes the equation

This mixup uses positional stack commands to keep the relevant variables on the
stack instead.  This is safer but slightly more complex to implement

    m:quadratic2                 \ # assume the stack contains a, b, c in order
      1 pc v v *                 \ # grab b and push w=b*b, stack is a b c w
      3 pc v 2 px v 4 * * - sqrt \ # Calculate x = sqrt(w - 4ac), stack is a b x
      s -                        \ # calculate y=x-b, stact is a y
      s 2 * /                      # y/2a completes the equation
"""

DOCS['Display Modes'] = """
On startup, rpncalc will show results in either floating point or integer
format, like this:

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0         
    y = 3.14159265359

There are, however, a number of optional display modes available that  also
show the data in a converted format.  Here is the basic catalogue:

    3 fixed # Fixed Mode (variable number of digits):

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          | 1234.000
    y = 3.14159265359   | 3.142

    hex # Hexidecimal

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          | 0x04D2
    y = 3.14159265359   | 0x03

    bin # Binary

    0b1000 0b1001
    x = 8               | 0b1000
    y = 9               | 0b1001

    dur # Convert from seconds to time duration

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          |       20:34
    y = 3.14159265359   |       00:03

    date # Assume epoch time

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          | 12/31/1969+16:20:34 (Wed)
    y = 3.14159265359   | 12/31/1969+16:00:03 (Wed)

    time # Guess if this is a duration or epoch time

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          |       20:34
    y = 3.14159265359   |       00:03

    $ # Money display

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          |  $1234.00
    y = 3.14159265359   |  $3.14

    cent # Cent-wise money

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0          |  $12.34
    y = 3.14159265359   |  $0.03

Note that only x and y are converted by default.  Use the .. command to see the
whole stack converted:

    ..

    s4 = 10.0            |  $0.10
    s3 = 42.0            |  $0.42
    s2 = 1234.0          |  $12.34
    s1 = 3.14159265359   |  $0.03

To turn off special display modes, use the normal command:

    normal

    10.0  42.0
    x = 1234.0         
    y = 3.14159265359

A couple more notes on Display Modes:

   - Display modes are informational only.  The actual data on the stack is
     the number to the left of the `|` in the output
   - The format displayed to the right of the `|` can generally be entered as
     valid input but, because it's often lossy, the number you'll get back is
     not exactly the same as the data on the stack.  A trivial example:

    |> 1.2345 2 fixed
    y = 1.2345          | 1.23

    |fixed2|> 1.23
    x = 1.2345          | 1.23
    y = 1.23            | 1.23

    |fixed2|> -
    y = 0.0045          | 0.00

### Automatic mode changes

rpncalc will automatically enable certain display modes based on your input
patterns under these conditions:

   - If you enter a hexidecimal number or use a logical operator (e.g. 0x1234), 
     hex mode is auto-enabled
   - If you enter a duration (e.g. 2:47:56), duration mode is auto-enabled
   - If you enter a time or date (e.g. 01/01/2010), time mode is auto-enabled
   - If you do any conversions, fixed mode is auto-enabled

To disable auto-enabling of modes, use the 'manual' command.  Use the 'auto'
command to re-enable display mode auto-enabling.

### Batch and Interactive Modes

Batch mode will only print out the formatted result of the bottom of the stack.
Interactive mode prints a more compete stack view.  Batch is default when
running rpncalc from the command line (e.g. rpncalc '4 5 +'), while
interactive is the interactive default.

### Example

    batch 4 5 +
      9.0            
    interactive 5 6 +
     x = 9.0            
     y = 11.0
"""

DOCS['Expression Debugging'] = """
Normally, when stack terms are entered on the same line, there is no output
printed until the last element on the line is reached.  When 'debug' is
activated, the stack is printed after each operator.  This can be useful when
defining a complex macro or investigating a suspicious calculation result.

### Example

    |> m:dist d * s d * + sqrt
    Defined macro: dist
    |> 3 4 @dist
      y = 5.0

      y = 5.0     
"""

DOCS['Exiting'] = """
You can exit with 'q'.  [Ctrl-D] also works.
"""

DOCS['Logical Operators'] = """
Logical operators are useful for programmers, especially in low-level languages
such as C and assembly.  Operators use the same syntax as you would see in the C
language.  By default, Hex mode is enabled automatically after the first hex
value is pushed to the stack.

### Example

    0x1234 2 >>          # Right-shift
    1 5 << 0xFFFFFFFF ^  # create a bit mask for bit 5
"""

DOCS['Macros and Conditionals'] = """
Macros and conditionals allow for simple programming concepts to be implemented.
The m: syntax is used to define a macro.  Later @macro can be used to execute
it.  The stack is used for argument passing and return values for the most part,
although you can also use the clipboard to hold variables.  Be aware that these
variables are global though!

For an example, let's first define a macro that can produce the next fibonacci
number
in a series, assuming that the pattern is already seeded with 0, 1 on the stack:

    m:fib_next \\
      d 2 pc v +  # z = x+y

Now to complete the concept by defining fibonacci to set up the stack initially
and `fib_test` and `fib_iter` helper macros to push the process along

    m:fibonacci   \\
        2 - x:i   \\ # Subtract 2 from arg and push 
        0 1       \\ # Push the first 2 numbers in the series
        @fib_test   # kick off the iterator

    m:fib_test \\
        v:i 0 > ?fib_iter  # If iterator is not expired then make another digit

    m:fib_iter      \\
        @fib_next   \\ # Make the digit
        v:i 1 - x:i \\ # Decrement the counter
        @fib_test     # See if there is more to do

    15 @fibonacci # Generate the first 15 numbers

As you can see, programming with this calculator is possible but complex
implementations are beyond the current goals.

Note that turning on debug mode can be a valuable aid in testing macros.

### Conditionals

Conditionals return 1 or 0.  If `rpncalc` is not in mixed mode, these will
automatically be converted to floats.  The `?` macro operator works correctly
whether the argument is a integer or a float.  Here is an example for clarity:

    |> 1 2 > 1 2 <
      x = 0.0            
      y = 1.0            

    |> mixed

    |mix|> 1 2 > 1 2 <
      0.0  1.0
      x = 0              
      y = 1              

    |mix|> m:foo 1234

    |mix|> D 1 ?foo
       y = 1234           

    |mix|> D 0 ?foo

    |mix|> D 1.0 ?foo
      y = 1234           
    
    |mix|> D 0.0 ?foo
"""

DOCS['Misc'] = """
Miscellaneous functions include showing help, and sourcing files that contain
commands.
"""

DOCS['Numbers'] = """
rpncalc accepts a number of different number formats.  In many cases, choosing a
special number format will change the display mode to support output of that
format.  See "Display Modes" for more information on how this works and how to
change the behavior.

Note that rpncalc supports both integer and floating point operations but
converts all numbers to floating point by default.  Use the 'mixed' and
'floats' commands to change this behavior.  You can also use 't' to swap
the number at the top of the stack between integer and floating point.

"""

DOCS['Trigonometry'] = """
`rpncalc` can calculate trigonometry results in either degrees or radians.  Use
'deg' and 'rad' to change the mode.
"""

DOCS['Complex Numbers'] = """
`rpncalc` supports complex numbers.  You can use`i` or `j` to enter them in
rectangular form.  Whatever format you used last will be used for display:

    |> 5+4i
      y = 5.0+4.0i       

    |> 6-2j
      x = 5.0+4.0j       
      y = 6.0-2.0j  

All of the following ways can be used to input a complex number in rectangular form:

    |> i
      y = 1.0i           

    |> D -i
      y = -1.0i          

    |> D 1+i
      y = 1.0+1.0i       

    |> D 5-4i
      y = 5.0-4.0i       

    |> D 6 i 7 * -
      y = 6.0-7.0i       

    |> D -1 sqrt
      y = 1.0i       

If the imaginary part of a number happens to become zero, the `i` is dropped
from the number:

    |> 5+5i
      y = 5.0+5.0i       

    |> 4-5i +
      y = 9.0 

You can also enter complex number in polar form by using `<`.  By default, the
angle is interpreted as radians, but putting the calculator in degree mode
changes this interetation. Entering a complex number in polar form automatically
enters `polar` display mode (unless `manual` mode was set to supress this):

    |> 5<3.14
      y = -4.99999365864+0.00796326458243i | 5.0<3.14

    |polar|> deg
      y = -4.99999365864+0.00796326458243i | 5.0<179.908747671

    |polar|deg|> D -6<90
      y = -3.67394039744e-16-6.0i | 6.0<-90.0

    |polar|deg|> rad
      y = -3.67394039744e-16-6.0i | 6.0<-1.57079632679

Like all display modes, polar display mode is just an "on the fly" conversion.
The rectangular form is always stored on the stack, as can be seen on the
left side of the `|` in the output.

Sometimes the phase or the magnitude of the polar expression is on the stack.
For phase, you can simply omit the angle from the expression and it will
be pulled from the stack.

    |> v:pi 2 /
      y = 1.57079632679  
       
    |> 5<
      y = 3.06161699787e-16+5.0i | 5.0<1.57079632679

    |polar|> deg
      y = 3.06161699787e-16+5.0i | 5.0<90.0

To pull the magnitude from the stack, create a polar number of magnitude 1,
then multiply in the magnitude.  This example pulls both numbers from the stack:

    |> deg

    |deg|> 5 45 1< *
      y = 3.53553390593+3.53553390593i | 5.0<45.0

The `polar` display mode can be used to enter polar display mode at any time:

    |> 1+i
      y = 1.0+1.0i       

    |> deg polar
      y = 1.0+1.0i        | 1.41421356237<45.0

The fixed display mode supports complex numbers most other display modes ignore
the imaginary part:

    |> 2 fixed 12.345+34.567i
      y = 12.345+34.567i  | 12.35+34.57i

    |fixed2|> hex
      y = 12.345+34.567i  | 0x0C

There is also a `fixedpolar` display mode that displays polar results with a fixed
number of digits.

    |> 1+i deg 3 fixedpolar
      y = 1.0+1.0i        | 1.414<45.000
"""

DOCS['Type Conversion'] = """
rpncalc has a fairly robust conversion mode that can handle conversion between
different ratios of products or inverses.  Some good examples of this are:

### Examples

    10 mph>min/mile
    5 gallons>in*in*in
    90 kwh>kj

The basic pattern is:

    old>new

Where wither old or new can be a single unit type or a product of types.  The
conversion engine is smart enough to invert old, if needed for a unit match.
The engine is also smart enough to detect unit mismatch, for example:

    1 acre>feet  (Error)
    1 acre>feet*feet (Ok)

use the `l:c` command to list all known conversion types.
"""

In interactive mode, every time you hit [Enter], rpncalc snapshots the state of
your stack (if it changed) before executing any commands.  You can then use 'u'
and 'r' to step forward and backward though historical stack states.  This can
be used to correct mistakes or (slightly) abused to assist with calculations.
